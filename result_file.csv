Prices are slightly cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.

The website was great. Had the tyres I wanted at a good price and the options for fitting were great. However. I opted for the.

I then got a phone call 5 minutes before 12pm to tell me the tyres would not be fitted that day as they didn't get to the fitter in time.. I had arranged a half day off work to do this.

Bad experience this time. Garage didnt balance wheels properly. Took car back and they rebalanced- car was even worse. I drove 500 miles to Scotland with a wobbly steering wheel. A [REDACTED] dealer in Scotland has hopefully sorted it today. I complained and to date no one at [REDACTED] has resolved my complaint after a chase up email sent yesterday. Poor service.

I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with. I presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them, just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out.","['delivery punctuality negative', 'location positive', 'ease of booking negative', 'value for money positive']","1, 7, 2, 9","(2,)","['delivery punctuality negative', 'location positive', 'ease of booking negative', 'value for money positive']",['ease of booking negative']

"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.",['garage service negative'],4,"(4,)",['garage service negative'],['garage service negative']

Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great.

Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled.

The fitter spent 10 minutes on his mobile phone in the middle of the job and when I asked the Receptionist if they would swap the tyres ""front to back and back to front"" I was told there would be a charge of £6.99 per wheel, despite the car already being raised to fit two new tyres.

"What can I say... I'm a typical girl! The only thing that usually concerns me about my car is the 'pretty' colour!... 😏... so, when it comes to getting new tyres for my Hyundai Tucson, I was clueless! Anyway, I popped onto [REDACTED] website and I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences ever!!! I literally put in my number plate and up popped a bunch of tyres at various prices from budget to high end! The price included delivery to a local garage, VAT and fitting and took me about 5 minutes from start to finish. I paid online and then got two emails, one confirming payment and the other to arrange fitting. I did this online too from the link in the email which showed me several garages in my area... I went to my appointment 3 days later at 9am (my choice, they could have done it even sooner!) and they were waiting for me with my two new tyres! Fantastic service and attention from start to finish. I have recommended [REDACTED] to so many people since... and also the garage that fitted them, HiQ in Stocton Road, Guildford.

Your technician showed up at 8:10 with no apology or explanation. I gave him my keys, he said it would take around half an hour. 20 minutes later at 8:30 he phoned me to say he couldn’t find my locking nut, I explained where it was (in the tyre-change kit…not a particularly obtuse place for it to be located?), he still couldn’t find it. I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn’t have time to rummage through people’s stuff. I submit that if he’d shown up on time he’d have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff.

"ABSOLUTELY USELESS[REDACTED] have possibly the worst booking system I’ve ever come across. I selected a local garage on Saturday 23 March at 9am and received confirmation of this appointment. When I arrived at the garage, at the booked date and time, the garage told me my appointment was for 10am the day before.

That’s fine, however [REDACTED] neglected to inform me of this and I had to rearrange my entire weekend plans. The garage was able to fit me in on the Sunday morning, however myself, my daughter and my parents had to change our entire weekend plans to accommodate this. Also, my wife bought a tyre through the [REDACTED] website, using the correct reference details and [REDACTED] sent the wrong tyre to the garage. My wife has now had to wait a week for [REDACTED] to issue the correct tyre and the garage to have the availability to fit her in.I would not use or recommend [REDACTED] to anyone.
